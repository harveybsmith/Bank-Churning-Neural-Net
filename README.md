# Bank_Churning
A large fictional European bank has been seeing unusually high churn rates from its customers recently (customers leaving).  So they took a sample of 10,000 of their current clients and waited 6 months to see which ones left.  My task is to come up with a model looking at the different variables of each client such as:

* CustomerId
* Surname
* Credit Score
* Geography (country)
* Gender
* Age
* Tenure
* Balance
* The number of products they use from the bank: eg. savings account, loan, trust fund, ect.
* Owns a credit card or not
* Is an active member, whether they have logged in to their online banking, made a transaction, ect.
* Estimated Salary

* And the dependent variable, Exited.  Whether they left the bank or not after six months.

This same model is transferable and can be applied to customers of the bank to see whether they are eligible for a loan or not.  All that needs to be done is changed the dependent variable to whether they have defaulted on a loan or not, and take a sample of customers who recieved loans.
